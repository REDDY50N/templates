# Custom Live ISO Generator

## Introduction
This project contains of a simple shell script that can be possibly edited and extended for creating a pre-configured custom Linux.

## Architecture
The output ISO is based on Ubuntu/Debian architecture. It uses LXQt as standard desktop environment(you can use any Qt desktop environment of your choice).

## Build
**Building Locally**

```console
$ chmod +x ./build.sh
```
2. Execute the script

You can test the ISO in any virtual desktop environment.
